- make the pawn's overall smelling factor a flat multiplier towards food eaten


Patch Notes
- Added support for more base game flowers that I forgot
- Added three new genes for each of the existing traits
- Added a new mod setting to limit scents to things that only exist in the home zone (off by default)
- Added a new mod setting to enable / disable scent stacking (on by default)
- Added (some) support for Combat Extended (black powder smoke unfortunately cannot be given a smell at the moment due to limitations of the game)
- Added support for Overflowing Flowers
- Improved nose identification system (birds can smell now)
- Improved ModExtension_Scent to allow for specifically dysosmic behaviors when a pawn has a certain trait or gene (in this case, any pawn with the bloodlust trait, kill thirst gene or bloodfeeder gene now loves the smell of blood)
- Modified Biotech's Wasters xenotype to be genetically dyosmic
- Modified the flu, animal flu, and fibrous mechanites to influence a pawn's smelling capacity
- Fixed various typos of "dysosmic"
