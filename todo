- add a more things in ModExtension_Scent called "dysomicGenes" and "dysomicTraits" which takes a list of genes or traits and if the pawn has them, treat it as dysomic and reverse it
- add a mod setting to prevent smells from being smelled if they're outside of the home zone
- add a mod setting to enable / disable mood stacking (so only 1 thought ever applied instead of up to the mood's stack limit)

Patch Notes

- Added three new genes for each of the existing traits

- Added support for Overflowing Flowers
- Improved nose identification system (birds can smell now)
- Modified Biotech's Wasters xenotype to be genetically dyosmic
- Modified the flu, animal flu, and fibrous mechanites to influence a pawn's smelling capacity
